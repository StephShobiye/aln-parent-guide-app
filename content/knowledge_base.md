## What is an IDP?
An Individual Development Plan (IDP) is the main plan for supporting a learner with Additional Learning Needs (ALN) in Wales. It sets out the learner’s needs, outcomes, and the provision required to meet those needs. An IDP replaces old Statements and IEPs.

## Who can get an IDP?
Any learner with ALN who needs additional provision to access education should have an IDP. This includes children in school, those educated otherwise than at school (EOTAS), and children of compulsory school age who are educated at home (EHE) when the local authority is involved because ALN provision is required.

## How do I request an IDP assessment?
Write to the school’s ALNCo (or the local authority if your child is not on a school roll or you believe the LA should take responsibility). Explain your child’s needs, impact on learning, and why additional provision is required. Keep copies and ask for written acknowledgement.

## How quickly should decisions be made about an IDP?
Settings and local authorities should act without undue delay. Where information is needed from services, they should cooperate and respond promptly. If there are delays, ask for an update, reasons, and a target date, and consider a formal complaint if necessary.

## What should an IDP include?
Clear needs, measurable outcomes, specific provision (who, what, how often, where), review dates, and the name of the responsible body (school or LA). Provision should be described precisely (e.g., “3 × 30-minute SALT-led sessions weekly” rather than “some speech support”).

## Who is responsible for the IDP – the school or the local authority?
Usually a school maintains the IDP. The local authority must take over where needs are more complex or where the learner is not on a school roll, is EOTAS, or where it is not reasonable for the school to secure the needed provision.

## How do I request an IDP review?
Write to the school/LA asking for an IDP review. Explain what has changed (e.g., needs escalated, provision not delivered, placement breakdown). Reviews should consider progress, suitability of placement, and whether provision needs to change.

## What evidence is useful for an IDP assessment or review?
Recent reports (e.g., SALT, OT, EP), medical letters, incident logs, attendance patterns, examples of work, and parent/young person views. Keep a simple diary of needs/impact and any strategies that help.

## What if the IDP is inaccurate or uses copied/outdated information?
Request corrections in writing. Ask the school/LA to record parent/young person views and to attach the corrected documents. If errors are not fixed, escalate through complaints and, where appropriate, appeal routes.

## What is EOTAS?
Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS) is education arranged by the local authority for a learner who cannot attend a school setting. Provision should be suitable to needs and can include tutors, online learning, therapies, and vocational options.

## How many hours should EOTAS provide?
There is no single fixed number of hours for every learner. Provision should be sufficient to meet the learner’s needs, support progress towards outcomes, and reflect health/sensory regulation needs. Ask for hours, subjects, therapies and transition goals to be specified in the IDP.

## Can a child on EOTAS still access health services and school nursing (e.g., vaccines)?
Yes. Being EOTAS does not remove access to health services. Contact your local health board/school nursing team to arrange vaccinations and routine checks, and ask your LA contact to help coordinate.

## Does Elective Home Education (EHE) stop the local authority’s duties for ALN?
No. If a learner with ALN requires provision that parents cannot reasonably be expected to secure, the local authority must consider its duties and whether it should maintain the IDP and arrange ALN provision. Discuss options with the LA before making changes.

## What happens at age 16+ – does the IDP end?
No. IDPs can continue beyond compulsory school age. Reviews should plan for transition (college, training, EOTAS, supported internships, etc.). Ask for a transition review well before the end of Year 11.

## What can I do if my child’s placement is breaking down or is “unsafe”?
Request an urgent IDP review. Keep records of incidents, exclusions, reduced timetables and wellbeing impact. Ask for interim measures (reduced sensory load, 1:1 support, safe space, timetable adjustments) and consider whether LA should take responsibility or EOTAS is required.

## How do I get reasonable adjustments in school?
Adjustments should be recorded in the IDP and classroom plans: sensory regulation breaks, alternative assessment formats, assistive technology, quiet space, visual supports, flexible start/finish, and consistent key staff. Check that adjustments are specific and measurable.

## What if provision in the IDP is not delivered?
Raise it in writing and request a compliance check. Ask for the delivery record (who, what, when), reasons for missed provision, and a plan to catch up. Keep a log of missed sessions and escalate if needed.

## What are my disagreement resolution options?
Start with the school/LA complaints process and request meetings. Independent disagreement resolution/mediation can help. You may be able to appeal certain decisions to the Education Tribunal for Wales; check current guidance and time limits before appealing.

## Can I get the IDP in Welsh and speak to services in Welsh?
Yes. You have a right to use Welsh. Ask for the IDP and correspondence in Welsh and request Welsh-medium provision where appropriate.

## How do I keep everything organised?
Keep a single digital folder with: timeline, contacts, meeting notes, letters you send/receive, evidence, and copies of the latest IDP/reviews. Use the App’s printable templates for requests, reviews and complaints to save time.
