  <h1>Year 7 Transition Tips</h1>
  <p>Moving from primary to secondary school can be exciting and daunting.  Early planning helps ensure your child receives the right support and feels confident about the change.  Use this checklist to guide you through the process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>☐ Request a transition review meeting with your child’s primary school and the receiving secondary school by the start of Year 6.  This meeting should set transition goals and confirm what support will transfer.</li>
    <li>☐ Visit potential secondary schools with your child.  Speak to the school’s Additional Learning Needs Co‑ordinator (ALNCo) and ask how they support learners with similar needs.  Ask to see learning support centres or nurture bases.</li>
    <li>☐ Consider whether your child would benefit from a phased transition (e.g. part‑days or reduced timetable) or extra visits to familiarise them with the new environment.  Ask the secondary school if they offer summer transition sessions or buddy schemes.</li>
    <li>☐ Ensure the IDP contains specific transition goals, such as social integration targets, independence skills and any adjustments needed for lessons or lunch times.  Make sure both schools have an up‑to‑date copy of the IDP and that the new ALNCo has read it.</li>
    <li>☐ Share any additional information that may help the new staff understand your child’s needs (for example, behaviour plans, risk assessments, communication passports or sensory profiles).</li>
    <li>☐ Work on practical skills at home: using a locker, organising books, reading a timetable, travelling to school safely and using public transport if necessary.  Practise daily routines and problem‑solving strategies.</li>
    <li>☐ Support your child emotionally by talking about what will change and what will stay the same.  Encourage them to ask questions and express worries.  Reassure them that support will continue in secondary school.</li>
    <li>☐ Keep lines of communication open.  Set up a contact point at the secondary school (e.g. the ALNCo or form tutor) and arrange regular check‑ins during the first term to review how the transition is going and adjust support if needed.</li>
  </ul>
