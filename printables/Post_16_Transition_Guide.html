  <h1>Post‑16 Transition Guide</h1>
  <p>When your child reaches the end of compulsory school age, you will need to decide what happens next.  Post‑16 education can take many forms: sixth‑form or college courses, vocational or work‑based learning (such as apprenticeships), supported internships for young people with additional needs, bespoke Education Otherwise Than at School (EOTAS) packages and training programmes.  Planning ahead gives you time to explore these options and ensures the right support is in place.</p>

  <h2>Understanding your options</h2>
  <p>Ask your child what they enjoy and what subjects or careers they are interested in.  Research qualifications on offer (for example, A‑levels, GCSE resits, BTECs and vocational diplomas) and find out which settings provide them.  Remember that young people with additional learning needs are entitled to reasonable adjustments and tailored programmes through their IDP.</p>

  <h2>Questions to ask providers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What courses, subjects or qualifications are available and how are they assessed?</li>
    <li>How will my child’s additional learning needs be supported and who will be the point of contact?</li>
    <li>What pastoral or wellbeing support is offered (counselling, mentoring, on‑site therapy)?</li>
    <li>How are travel and transport arranged and funded for learners who cannot travel independently?</li>
    <li>What enrichment activities or work experience opportunities are available?</li>
    <li>How will you communicate with us about progress and any concerns?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Preparing for transition</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Request a transition review meeting in Year 10 or early Year 11 so that the IDP can be updated with post‑16 goals and outcomes.  Involve your child in setting these targets.</li>
    <li>Visit potential providers with your child.  Meet Additional Learning Needs Coordinators (ALNCos), tutors and support staff to discuss how they will meet your child’s needs.</li>
    <li>Ask each provider to explain how therapies and specialist support (e.g. Speech and Language, Occupational Therapy) will be delivered.  Check whether they have experience with similar needs.</li>
    <li>Check application deadlines, transport arrangements and any appeals or appeals processes.  Keep copies of all correspondence and application forms.</li>
    <li>Encourage your child to practise independent living skills such as time‑keeping, organisation and travel training.  Consider taster days or shadowing programmes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Rights and next steps</h2>
  <p>If the local authority refuses to name your preferred post‑16 placement or fails to provide appropriate support, you have the right to appeal to the Education Tribunal for Wales.  Continue to keep detailed records of meetings, decisions and evidence of your child’s needs.  If EOTAS is considered, request a detailed package outlining the hours, subjects, qualifications and social opportunities on offer.  Make sure any decisions are recorded in the IDP.</p>
