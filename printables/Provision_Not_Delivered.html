  <h1>Provision Not Delivered</h1>
  <p>Use this template to record any support, session or therapy specified in your child’s Individual Development Plan (IDP) that has not been provided.  Keeping a clear record of missed provision will help you when raising concerns with the school or local authority and may be useful evidence if you need to seek enforcement through the Education Tribunal.</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Date</th><th>Provision Missed</th><th>Person or service responsible</th><th>Reason (if given)</th><th>Action taken</th></tr>
    <tr><td>e.g. 01/10/2025</td><td>SALT session</td><td>Speech therapist</td><td>Therapist absent</td><td>Logged, asked for catch‑up session</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>Tips for using this record:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete a row each time a scheduled session or provision is missed.  Include as much detail as possible about the type of provision and the person or service responsible.</li>
    <li>If no reason is given for the absence, note “reason not provided.”  Ask for an explanation in writing and keep any emails or letters received.</li>
    <li>In the “Action taken” column, record how you responded (for example, requesting a catch‑up session, speaking to the ALNCo, contacting the local authority).</li>
    <li>Once you have identified a pattern, send this record with a covering letter requesting a plan to deliver the missed provision and prevent further breaches.  If the issue is not resolved, you can ask the local authority to conduct a compliance check of the IDP.</li>
  </ul>
