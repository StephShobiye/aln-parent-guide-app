  <h1>EOTAS Entitlement Guide</h1>
  <p>This guide summarises your child’s rights to education otherwise than at school (EOTAS) under the Additional Learning Needs (ALN) system in Wales.  It explains when EOTAS may be appropriate and what to expect from the local authority.</p>
  <h2>When is EOTAS considered?</h2>
  <p>EOTAS is arranged by the local authority when a child cannot attend a mainstream or special school because their needs cannot be met there.  Reasons may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The school placement has broken down and cannot be made safe.</li>
    <li>The child is medically unable to attend school.</li>
    <li>No suitable school place is available within reasonable travelling time.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What does EOTAS include?</h2>
  <p>EOTAS provision should be tailored to your child and might include home tuition, online learning, therapy sessions, vocational training or community‑based education.  The IDP should specify hours, subjects, therapies and how progress will be reviewed.</p>
  <h2>Key points</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>EOTAS should offer a broad and balanced curriculum.</li>
    <li>The local authority remains responsible for arranging provision set out in the IDP.</li>
    <li>Transport to off‑site EOTAS sessions should be provided if needed.</li>
    <li>Health services (e.g., vaccinations) remain accessible even when your child is not in school.</li>
  </ul>
