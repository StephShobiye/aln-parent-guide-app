### What is an IDP?
An Individual Development Plan (IDP) is the main plan for supporting a learner with Additional Learning Needs (ALN) in Wales.  It sets out the learner’s needs, outcomes and the provision required to meet those needs.  An IDP replaces old Statements and IEPs.

### Who can get an IDP?
Any learner with ALN who needs additional provision to access education should have an IDP.  This includes children in school, those educated otherwise than at school (EOTAS), and children of compulsory school age who are educated at home (EHE) when the local authority is involved because ALN provision is required.

### How do I request an IDP assessment?
Write to the school’s ALNCo (or the local authority if your child is not on a school roll or you believe the LA should take responsibility).  Explain your child’s needs, impact on learning and why additional provision is required.  Keep copies and ask for written acknowledgement.

### How quickly should decisions be made about an IDP?
Settings and local authorities should act without undue delay.  Where information is needed from services, they should co‑operate and respond promptly.  If there are delays, ask for an update, reasons and a target date, and consider a formal complaint if necessary.

### What should an IDP include?
Clear needs, measurable outcomes, specific provision (who, what, how often, where) and review dates.  Provision should be described precisely (e.g., “3 × 30‑minute SALT‑led sessions weekly” rather than “some speech support”).  The name of the responsible body (school or LA) should be recorded.

### Who is responsible for the IDP – the school or the local authority?
Usually a school maintains the IDP.  The local authority must take over where needs are more complex or where the learner is not on a school roll, is EOTAS, or where it is not reasonable for the school to secure the needed provision.

### How do I request an IDP review?
Write to the school/LA asking for an IDP review.  Explain what has changed (e.g., needs escalated, provision not delivered, placement breakdown).  Reviews should consider progress, suitability of placement and whether provision needs to change.

### What evidence is useful for an IDP assessment or review?
Recent reports (e.g., SALT, OT, EP), medical letters, incident logs, attendance patterns, examples of work and parent/young person views.  Keep a simple diary of needs/impact and any strategies that help.

### What if the IDP is inaccurate or uses copied/outdated information?
Request corrections in writing.  Ask the school/LA to record parent/young person views and to attach the corrected documents.  If errors are not fixed, escalate through complaints and, where appropriate, appeal routes.

### What is EOTAS?
Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS) is education arranged by the local authority for a learner who cannot attend a school setting.  Provision should be suitable to needs and can include tutors, online learning, therapies and vocational options.

### How many hours should EOTAS provide?
There is no single fixed number of hours for every learner.  Provision should be sufficient to meet the learner’s needs, support progress towards outcomes and reflect health/sensory regulation needs.  Ask for hours, subjects, therapies and transition goals to be specified in the IDP.

### Can a child on EOTAS still access health services and school nursing (e.g., vaccines)?
Yes.  Being EOTAS does not remove access to health services.  Contact your local health board/school nursing team to arrange vaccinations and routine checks, and ask your LA contact to help co‑ordinate.

### Does Elective Home Education (EHE) stop the local authority’s duties for ALN?
No.  If a learner with ALN requires provision that parents cannot reasonably be expected to secure, the local authority must consider its duties and whether it should maintain the IDP and arrange ALN provision.  Discuss options with the LA before making changes.

### What happens at age 16+ – does the IDP end?
No.  IDPs can continue beyond compulsory school age.  Reviews should plan for transition (college, training, EOTAS, supported internships, etc.).  Ask for a transition review well before the end of Year 11.

### What can I do if my child’s placement is breaking down or is “unsafe”?
Request an urgent IDP review.  Keep records of incidents, exclusions, reduced timetables and wellbeing impact.  Ask for interim measures (reduced sensory load, 1:1 support, safe space, timetable adjustments) and consider whether the LA should take responsibility or EOTAS is required.

### How do I get reasonable adjustments in school?
Adjustments should be recorded in the IDP and classroom plans: sensory regulation breaks, alternative assessment formats, assistive technology, quiet space, flexible start/finish, and consistent key staff.  Check that adjustments are specific and measurable.

### What if provision in the IDP is not delivered?
Raise it in writing and request a compliance check.  Ask for the delivery record (who, what, when), reasons for missed provision and a plan to catch up.  Keep a log of missed sessions and escalate if needed.

### What are my disagreement resolution options?
Start with the school/LA complaints process and request meetings.  Independent disagreement resolution/mediation can help.  You may be able to appeal certain decisions to the Education Tribunal for Wales; check current guidance and time limits before appealing.

### Can I get the IDP in Welsh and speak to services in Welsh?
Yes.  You have a right to use Welsh.  Ask for the IDP and correspondence in Welsh and request Welsh‑medium provision where appropriate.

### How do I keep everything organised?
Keep a single digital folder with: timeline, contacts, meeting notes, letters you send/receive, evidence and copies of the latest IDP/reviews.  Use the App’s printable templates for requests, reviews and complaints to save time.

## New Guidance for Release 4.0
In addition to the core questions above, this release adds information on topics raised by parents during 2024–25.  These entries will be expanded over time; placeholders are included where detailed guidance is still being prepared.

### How do I plan for the transition from primary to secondary school (Year 7)?
Begin preparing in Year 5 or early Year 6.  Request a transition review meeting to discuss your child’s needs, tour prospective schools, and agree support to make the move successful.  Use our **Year 7 Transition Tips** printable to plan questions and record decisions.

### What should I know about post‑16 options?
Post‑16 education can include mainstream college, sixth form, apprenticeships, supported internships and bespoke EOTAS packages.  Your child’s IDP should be reviewed in Year 11 to map out options.  See the **Post‑16 Transition Guide** printable for questions to ask colleges and information on transport and funding.

### How do I appeal to the Education Tribunal for Wales?
You can appeal certain decisions (refusal to assess, contents of an IDP, refusal to put education in place, etc.).  Appeals must usually be made within 8 weeks of the decision.  Use our **Tribunal Appeal Letter** printable as a starting point and consider seeking specialist legal advice.

### What if my child’s needs can only be met out of area or across a border?
Some learners need specialist placements not available locally.  The local authority can name an out‑of‑area school or cross‑border provision on an IDP, and must arrange transport if necessary.  See our **Cross‑Border Toolkit** for guidance on evidence and steps to secure such placements.

### Do I have to accept an out‑of‑area placement I can’t access?
You can ask the local authority to reconsider if a named placement is too far, unsafe or unsuitable.  Provide reasons and supporting evidence.  If unresolved, you can appeal to the Education Tribunal.  Our **Complaint Letter** printable includes wording to use.

### What support is available if my child is at risk of exclusion or part‑time timetable?
Schools must avoid excluding children because of their disability.  Ask for a behaviour plan, positive handling plan and risk assessment.  Request help from the LA’s ALN team and consider EOTAS if the placement cannot be made safe.  See our **Advocacy Letter** printable for wording.

### How do I challenge a refusal to deliver therapies or adjustments?
If a therapy specified in the IDP is missed or refused (e.g., Speech and Language, Occupational Therapy, CAMHS), record the missed sessions and ask for reasons.  Escalate through the complaints process and, if necessary, seek tribunal enforcement.  Our **Provision Not Delivered** template can be used for this purpose.

### Placeholder topics for Release 4.0
- Cross‑border examinations and qualification frameworks – guidance coming soon.
- Parental mental health and respite support – resources under development.
- Transport for post‑16 and EOTAS – new FAQs and checklists coming soon.
